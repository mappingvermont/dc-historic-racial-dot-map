zoom 13 is likely the min zoom level for one person = one dot
spatially joining 1940 points to z13, the max count for one tile is 172682
this is less than the max for a tile (512*512 = 262144) but z12 is likely to be more
    ^^ this is true if all dots were distributed equally, but looks like might have to be z25 for this to actually be true

# racial dot map z13 tile (their max) example:
http://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/tiles4/13/2339/3132.png

# but mapbox pngs are 256*256 = 65536
so will likely have to go to z14 (and maybe z15) to get actual representation

will be easy to go beyond this (z14, z15) but anything less than z13 will have to be resampled
spatially joining 256x256 tiles to points for 1940 - max is 60,277 points in a tile, so z14 could work

### TODO

figure out what pixel sizes are appropriate for what mapnik zoom levels
1:1 doesn't look great - may have to use a z14 resolution at z12, etc

rasters with cell size for z15 looks great at zoom level 14 on the map
maybe try this (z+1) for every zoom level?

also need to figure out opacity - if necessary can do the same pop | no-pop bilinear interpolation
then recscale to 0 - 9, then tack this on to the last digit in the B band

also need to figure out mapnik transparency / nodata

do this all in rasterio??
should be a lot cleaner . . . can maybe even just add the numpy arrays that way
provided that they're all the same size

nice because it's such a small dataset
which i think is kind of the point of rasterio any way - tile-level work

consume this local tile service in QGIS to see if the rasters line up with the points at high zoom levels
good QC to make sure we are actually representing individual humans when possible

zoom level 24 for 1940 has 642,152 points, but total pop is 663,091
maybe use z25 for zoom level 16 and above? we'll see . . .
